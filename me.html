			<h1>Thoughts of dream accelerator</h1>
			<p>According to the U.S. Census, 38% of children from privileged districts are engaged in extracurriculars including school clubs. This percentage drops significantly in underfunded districts at a mere 26%. While the issue of lack in school club funding already exists in privileged neighborhoods, this problem becomes much more prominent in affluent Latino and Black neighborhoods. The lack of district funding directly hinders a student’s option to run their own school club or to provide the club with resources that require additional financial support, which affects chances at college admissions and involvements in extracurricular activities. Students of our generation are constantly pushing to make an impact through involvement in extracurriculars and clubs. However, the only source of funding is through district funding. Our mission is to create more equal opportunities for students across the nation inclusive of all financial backgrounds.</p>
			<p>Dream Accelerator’s primary customer demographic are high school teenagers with an emphasis on lower income students and students who are looking to make an impact on society. Because the students have limited access to school clubs and organizations, the advantage of having a community revolving around similar club interests allows for a wider connection. Our website seeks out donors who are looking to fund local high school programs and student run organizations. And actually
			the most primary thing we want to help these clubs that is we want to enhance the celebrity of the clubs to let more and more people to know them and what type of programs they are focus on. Hence maybe some clubs have the same target, and they know each other from our website. In this way they can contact with each other to make collaborations.</p>

			<p>Our team has dedicated a tremendous amount of time to customer validations and interviewing both high school students and adults about their opinions and insights on the Dream Accelerator platform. In our conclusion, more than 90% of the respondents believe that our problem is an existing issue and the solution is feasible, also able to make a social impact. Our customer interviews dedicated to high schoolers collected 50% of students living under communities in the Bay Area with income levels below $50,000 and reported the lack of funding that their local highschool provides to the students for non-academic activities. Furthermore, even the other 50% of privileged high school students living in wealthy areas with income levels above $150,000 described certain times where fundraising for their ideas can be a challenging task. In addition, a horrifying 64% of families with annual income less than $50,000 (comparatively low at locations with high living expenses such as California) sees their school districts as underfunded with the lack of ability to support students with extracurricular leadership activities.</p>
