        <p>The Zora Foundation is a student-led non-profit organization committed to empowering communities into civic engagement through activism and the arts with the goal of inspiring more youth to get involved in social justice and the creative arts. As a national organization, The Zora Foundation uses our platform to inspire and connect youth leaders and elevate student voices and work for positive social change. Each year, The Zora Foundation centers our focus on different social justice topics such as environmental justice, social discrimination, educational inequality, and food insecurity. 
		We host various art exhibitions, workshops and programs and publish an annual literary art magazine issue to spotlight student actions and to promote social awareness on our topic of focus. We have raised and spent approximately $4,000 on organizing such events and publications and in supporting other nonprofit and social justice organizations, such as The Rosieâ€™s Place, a community center supporting women through providing them with shelter, meals, and more. 
		As we are expanding our organization nationally and working to collaboratively host more social justice events, more funds are needed for operations, including venue rental, speaker fees, workshop materials, and promotion.</p>
